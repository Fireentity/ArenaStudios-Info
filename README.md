## About Us
ArenaStudios A.P.S. is a non-profit association that manages and develops the ArenaCraft project, an online community built around a multi-version (1.8â€“1.21.x) and multi-mode Minecraft server. The association is dedicated to fostering innovation in online gaming, managing community donations, and building custom technological solutions to improve the player experience.

## What We Do
ArenaStudios combines community management with software development. The team has created proprietary Java plugins and engineered advanced systems such as a replay framework built with Protocol Buffers, enabling full recording and serialization of server packets for match replays. Alongside in-game features, ArenaStudios also developed and deployed the official portal [arenacraft.it](https://arenacraft.it) using Laravel and Vue.js. The website includes a fully integrated Stripe-powered shop, replacing Tebex, which allowed the association to significantly cut operational costs and transaction fees while providing a seamless donation and purchase system for the community.

## Roles and Responsibilities
As co-founder, treasurer, and developer, I have been directly involved in both the administrative and technical aspects of ArenaStudios. I oversee financial management for the association, design and implement server-side features, and contribute to the development of the web platform and payment infrastructure.

## Mission
The mission of ArenaStudios is to build a sustainable, transparent, and innovative gaming environment that merges competitive play with community-driven growth. Through a mix of technical development, community engagement, and non-profit values, the association strives to provide players with a fair and enjoyable online experience.
